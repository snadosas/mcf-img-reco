# Mean Curvature Flow for Image Recognition

This repository contains the code of our proyect for the course **Numerical Analysis of PDEs** imparted at the FCFM, Universidad de Chile.

The outline of the project is to first simulate mean curvature flow using finite differences, and then modify the flow so that it can recognize images.
